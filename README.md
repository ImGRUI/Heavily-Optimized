# Heavily Optimized

Heavily Optimized is a **lightweight Fabric optimization** modpack, focused on **game optimization** and **some improvements**. It contains all needed and stability working mods, which improve perfomance and allow you to customize your minecraft a little more (not _OptiFine_ features, except shaders, more info below).

## Features

Heavily Optimized contains almost no visual difference beetween vanilla by default, but adds some enhancements to minecraft. This includes:
 - Sodium Extra settings;
 - Removes reloading screen, leaving only his progress bar;
 - Iris Shaders (doesn't affect perfomance when off, or it becomes slighty faster, watch tests). Why it added? Because some people want to use shader sometimes, for example, screenshots.
 - Fast quit to title screen from singleplayer world by saving it in the background;
 - Fixes a lot of minecraft bugs from bug tracker;
 - Increases chat hystory length;
 - Makes chat unreportable (where possible), using No Chat Reports.
